Java 8 Examples

## For Java programming, Java SE 8 offers a plethora of features. Some of them are

Lambda expression − Adds functional processing capability to Java.

Method references − Referencing functions by their names instead of invoking them directly. Using functions as parameter.

Default method − Interface to have default method implementation.

New tools − New compiler tools and utilities are added like ‘jdeps’ to figure out dependencies.

Stream API − New stream API to facilitate pipeline processing.

Date Time API − Improved date time API.

Optional − Emphasis on best practices to handle null values properly.

Nashorn, JavaScript Engine − A Java-based engine to execute JavaScript code.

ForEach() Method - In order to iterate over the Collection Framework, Java SE8 offers a new method called forEach which is defined in the Iterable interface. ForEach() loop can be used in a collection class that extends the interface Iterable. Since this method inputs a single parameter, a lambda expression can also be passed as a parameter.

StringJoiner - A new final class StringJoiner has been added to Java 8 in the java. util package. A sequence of characters can be constructed separated by delimiters like comma (,), hyphen (-), etc.
